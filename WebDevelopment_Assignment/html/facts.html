            <p class="history_detail">Kim Chaewon, the director of the museum, asked President Syngman Rhee to provide an appropriate space for the museum to preserve and exhibit <br>its collections. Rhee ordered part of Deoksugung Palace, which had been destroyed during the war, to be repaired and used as the new National Museum, which opened to the public in June 1955.</p>

            <h3 class="history_exp">In 1986, a project began to transform the former Joseon Government- <br>General building into a museum, with an initial investment of KRW 27.7 billion.</h3>
            <p class="history_detail">The museum opened on August 21, 1986, and displayed about 7,500 artifacts in twenty rooms. <br>They added new equipment like special lights, air conditioners, and security systems to protect the items.
                <br><br><br>They also had special exhibitions like "Korean Painting: 1850–1950," "The Beauty of Korea: Traditional Costumes, Ornaments, and Cloth Wrappings," <br>"Buddhist Sculpture of the Three Kingdoms Period," and "Special Exhibition of the Paintings of Kim Hong-do."
                <br><br><br>One of the exhibitions, "The Beauty of Korea," was a big hit during the 1988 Seoul Olympics. <br>In the 1990s, the museum started exchanging cultural items with other museums worldwide. They opened Korean galleries in <br>Los Angeles and England, and Korean cultural items were shown in museums in the USA, Japan, France, the UK, Spain, Belgium, and New Zealand.</p>

            <h3 class="history_exp">The NMK’s relocation to the former Joseon General-Government <br>building stirred a considerable amount of controversy, because many Koreans <br>saw that particular building as a symbol of colonialism.</h3>
            <p class="history_detail">The Korean government decided to move a collection of precious Korean items to a new museum <br>because the public didn't like where they were displayed. They planned to build the new museum in Yongsan Family Park in Seoul, <br>but it would take about ten years to finish. In the meantime, they moved the collection to a different place in 1996.
                <br><br><br>During this time, they had special exhibitions like "Korean Ancient Pottery," "The Tiger in Korean Art," <br>"Beauteous Kumgangsan, Diamond Mountain," "Hangeul, the Korean Alphabet," "Genre Paintings of the Joseon Period," and "Unified Silla." <br>They also received more than 12,000 donated relics between 2000 and 2004, showing that people in Korea liked the new museum's location in Yongsan.</p>

            <p class="history_detail">Yongsan, in the middle of Seoul, is a cultural hub surrounded by important landmarks like Mount Namsan, the Hangang River, palaces, and museums.
                <br><br><br>The new museum had better facilities and quickly became popular, with over 10 million visitors in about three and a half years. <br>In 2009, it ranked as the most visited museum in Asia and 10th in the world.
                <br><br><br>The museum transformed into a "cultural complex" for everyone, offering not just collections but also programs and events for the public. <br>Starting in 2008, they made permanent exhibitions free to encourage more visits. They also had exchange programs with international museums and hosted special exhibitions like "The Glory of Persia," "Egypt, the Great Civilization," and more.</p>
